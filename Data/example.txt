I think that's a new.    So our team is like an echo.    Sorry.    There we go.    So our team is Abby.    So Rob and myself.    And.    And.    But.    Jarvis is their automated meetings.    You have to.    No, I'm actually.    Recording myself on zoom because it's part of our demonstration.    So I think that might be the problem.    Can you hear me?    Okay.    Okay.    I'll just talk through the zoom.    think that works.    So our project manager.    Assistant.    is designed to reduce your workflow.    You can experience more convenient meetings, summarize right after they occur, and you can get a recap of your day's meetings with just a simple command.    So Jarvis helps with facilitating communication.    You can improve your team interactions and information just in minutes, and so nobody misses out.    You can make your workflow more efficient by streamlining, collaboration, and task management, and have more productive meetings, having focused and outcome-oriented outcomes without worrying about taking notes.    So the data flow starts with Fathom, which records our meetings on Zoom, and it sends the transcript as JSON through Zapier, whereas Zapier then converts the JSON to a TXT file and sends it    as opposed to our server.    And then our server calls the ClarifiedGPT4 Turbo model and summarizes the TXT.    We then store that into Superbase and the Slackbot returns a nicely summarized meeting just upon typing simple command slash daily summary.    So we have completed the daily summary command and we intend to keep adding a few other features such as slash answer where users can ask questions on the meetings that just happened and also gathering info, which essentially a project manager could send out Jarvis to ask questions to the people who attended the meeting and collect all their answers and they can streamline their project management workflow by doing so.    And more features just as users give their feedback.\n"}, {'transcript': "Impromptu Zoom Meeting - January 20\r\nVIEW RECORDING - 3 mins (25 secs of highlights): https://fathom.video/share/svNKhA3MsLqQPpg2jQ8Fa1DH33szKRYH\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n0:07 - Nimra Sharnez\r\n  Okay, that worked.
